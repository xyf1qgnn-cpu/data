## 📝 Notes

- Requirements are organized by timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM)
- Each requirement has its own folder with structured documentation
- Metadata is stored in `metadata.json` within each requirement folder
- Current active requirement is tracked in `.current-requirement`

## 🔄 Update Process

1. When starting a new requirement, a folder is created with timestamp
2. Requirements gathering proceeds through discovery and detail phases
3. Final specification is generated in `06-requirements-spec.md`
4. Progress is tracked in metadata and summarized in index
5. Requirements can be marked complete, incomplete, or cancelled

## 📈 Quality Metrics

- **Completeness**: All phases should have questions answered
- **Clarity**: Requirements should be specific and testable
- **Traceability**: Each requirement should be traceable to implementation
- **Maintainability**: Documentation should be clear and organized
